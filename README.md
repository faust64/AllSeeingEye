# AllSeeingEye

Minimalistic HTML file for monitoring purposes.

Having a station dedicated to monitoring, open your web browser to our
`index.html`. Fix URLs and layout matching your setup - aka: DIY.

Here, we load a couple Icinga Status Maps on top of our page - watching
over our private and public Icinga servers. While on the bottom half, on the
left of our page we display Smokeping graphs watching over self-hosted services.
The center loads our PHP-Weathermap. The right third loads an other bunch of
Smokeping graphs, watching over public services availability
